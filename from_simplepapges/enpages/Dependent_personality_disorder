Dependent personality disorder (DPD), formerly known as asthenic personality disorder, is a personality disorder that is characterized by a pervasive psychological dependence on other people. This personality disorder is a long-term condition in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs, with only a minority achieving normal levels of independence.
The cause of dependent personality disorder is unknown. TA study in 2012 estimated that between 55% and 72% of the risk of the condition is inherited from one's parents. The difference between a 'dependent personality' and a 'dependent personality disorder' is somewhat subjective, which makes diagnosis sensitive to cultural influences such as gender role expectations.


== Epidemiology ==
Dependent personality disorder occurs in about 0.6% of the general population. The disorder is diagnosed more often in females than males; however, research suggests that this is largely due to behavioural differences in interviews and self-reporting rather than a difference in prevalence between the sexes. A 2004 twin study suggests a heritability of 0.81 for developing dependent personality disorder. Because of this, there is significant evidence that this disorder runs in families. Children and adolescents with a history of anxiety disorders and physical illnesses are more susceptible to acquiring this disorder.


=== American Psychiatric Association ===
The DSM-IV-TR contains a Dependent Personality Disorder diagnosis. It refers to a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of which leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation. This begins by early adulthood and can be present in a variety of contexts.


=== World Health Organization ===
The World Health Organization's ICD-10 lists dependent personality disorder as F60.7 Dependent personality disorder:

It is characterized by at least 3 of the following:
encouraging or allowing others to make most of one's important life decisions;
subordination of one's own needs to those of others on whom one is dependent, and undue compliance with their wishes;
unwillingness to make even reasonable demands on the people one depends on;
feeling uncomfortable or helpless when alone, because of exaggerated fears of inability to care for oneself;
preoccupation with fears of being abandoned by a person with whom one has a close relationship, and of being left to care for oneself;
limited capacity to make everyday decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others.
Associated features may include perceiving oneself as helpless, incompetent, and lacking stamina.
Includes:
asthenic, inadequate, passive, and self-defeating personality (disorder)

It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria.


=== Millon's subtypes ===
Psychologist Theodore Millon identified five adult subtypes of dependent personality disorder. Any individual dependent may exhibit none or one of the following:


=== Differential diagnosis ===
The following conditions commonly coexist (comorbid) with dependent personality disorder:
mood disorders
anxiety disorders
adjustment disorder
borderline personality disorder
