Vulvar cancer, a type of cancer of the vulva. It accounts for about 4% of all gynecological cancers and typically affects women in later life. It was estimated that in the United States 3,740 cases were diagnosed and about 880 women died as a result. Vulvar carcinoma is separated from vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a non-invasive lesion of the epithelium that can progress via carcinoma-in-situ to squamous cell cancer, and from Paget disease of the vulva.
