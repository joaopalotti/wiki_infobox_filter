Kidney cancer is a form of cancer that begins in the kidneys. Common forms include Wilms tumor, which occurs in children, and renal cell carcinoma.


== Treatment ==
Treatment of renal cancer depends on the type of cancer. For renal cell carcinoma, removing the kidney, (Nephrectomy), is the best treatment when the cancer is localized. Removing a part of the kidney, (partial nephrectomy) may also be an option for some patients.
