Duodenal cancer is a type of cancer in the small intestine. It is something like gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Gardner Syndrome, Lynch Syndrome, Muir-Torre syndrome, Celiac sprue, Puetz-Jeghers, Crohn's Disease and Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome are risk factors for having this cancer.
The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is located between the stomach and the jejunum. After foods combine with stomach acid, they go down into the duodenum where they mix with bile from the gall bladder and digestive juices from the pancreas.
