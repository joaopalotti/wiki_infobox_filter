Progeria (pronunciation: /proʊˈdʒɪəriə/), also called Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome and HGPS progeria syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder. Children born with progeria show symptoms which are like aging. This can include skin wrinkles and grey hair or baldness. Progeria is one of several progeroid syndromes. The word progeria comes from the Greek words "pro" (πρό), meaning "before" or "premature", and "gēras" (γῆρας), meaning "old age".
It is very rare, only 1 child in every 8 million live births. People with progeria usually only live to their mid teens to early twenties. It is a genetic condition that occurs as a new mutation. It is rarely inherited, as people with the condition do not usually live long enough to have children.
Scientists are studying progeria because it might reveal clues about the normal process of aging. Progeria was first described in 1886 by Jonathan Hutchinson. It was also described independently in 1897 by Hastings Gilford. The condition was later named Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome.
