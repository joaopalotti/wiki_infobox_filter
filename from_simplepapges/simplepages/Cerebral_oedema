Cerebral Å“dema (or cerebral edema) is a build-up of extra fluid in the brain. It causes swelling. It is caused by physical trauma or an injury to the brain. This includes inflammation of the brain caused by some infections. Also, mountain climbers at high altitude have been known to experience cerebral oedema primarily due to reduced air pressure acting on the cranium.
