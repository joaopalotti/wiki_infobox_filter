Agranulocytosis is a medical condition where there are very few granulocytes (a kind of white blood cell) in the blood. It is a type of severe and dangerous leukopenia (a condition of very low number of white blood cells). If the agranulocytosis is because of a lack of neutrophils (called neutropenia), it is especially bad.
