A fugue state (dissociative fugue or psychogenic fugue) is a rare psychiatric disorder. It involves temporary loss of memory (amnesia). It usually only lasts a short time (from hours to days), but can last months or longer. In a fugue state, the person not only forgets all about who they are, but may suddenly adopt a new identity. They may leave home and wander, settle in another area with a new name. Fugue occurs to avoid stress and anxiety. After the fugue state comes to an end, the person recovers the memories they lost, but usually forgets all that happened during the fugue.
