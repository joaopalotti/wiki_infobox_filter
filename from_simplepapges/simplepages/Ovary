Ovaries (Singular: Ovary) are organs found in female organisms. Ovaries are part of the reproductive system needed to reproduce sexually.
Most vertebrates have ovaries. Usually animals have two ovaries. Birds usually have only one working ovary; snakes have one ovary in front of the other. The ovaries are similar to testicles in men.


== Anatomy ==
Ovaries are shaped like eggs and are around 3 cm by 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm. The ovary is found in the side walls of the pelvis.
Each ovary is attached to the Fallopian tube. Usually each ovary takes turns releasing eggs every month.


== Uses ==
Ovaries have two purposes:
Produce female sex hormones resulting in puberty
Produce ova (also called "egg cells"), which are the female reproductive cells.


== Menstruation ==

During menstruation, an ovum is released from the ovary to be fertilised. Ovaries have a certain number of eggs in them, so when eggs stop being released, this is the start of the menopause. During this time, female hormones stop being produced.
