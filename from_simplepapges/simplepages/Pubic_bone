The pubic bone is one of the bones that make up the pelvis. In the picture at right, it is called a pubis. It is ventral and anterior.
It is covered by a layer of fat, which is covered by the mons pubis.
It can be separated into a body, a superior ramus and an inferior ramus.
The body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum (the area around the hip socket), contributing by its outer surface both to the lunate surface and the acetabular fossa (the hip socket itself). Its inner surface enters into the formation of the wall of the lesser pelvis and gives origin to a part of the obturator internus.
In the female, the pubic bone is in front of the urethral sponge.
The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis.
