The lateral sulcus (also called Sylvian fissure or lateral fissure) is one of the most prominent structures of the human brain. It divides the frontal lobe and parietal lobe above from the temporal lobe below. It is in both hemispheres of the brain. A sulcus is a depression or groove in the cerebral cortex.
The lateral sulcus first appears around the fourteenth week of gestation.
