Relapsing fever is an infection caused by some bacteria in the genus Borrelia. It is sometimes called typhinia. It is carried and spread by lice and ticks.
The word "relapse" means to come back. The disease is called "relapsing fever" because the symptoms can go away and come back several times until the person is cured.
