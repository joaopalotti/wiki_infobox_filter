Webbed toes is the common name for syndactyly. Webbed feet happens when two or more toes grow together instead of separately. This is common in many birds such as ducks. It is also common in amphibians such as frogs and mammals such as kangaroos. In humans, it is not normal. It only happens to 3-10 in 10,000 live births.
