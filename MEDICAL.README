What is this branch for:

1) I downloaded the Simple and English dumps from Jan 2017.
2) Extracted pages from Simple Wiki that contained a list of keywords defined in keywords.def 
3) Downloaded those pages from both Simple and English wikipedia in a folder called from_simplepages
4) Build LMs from those different wikis.
